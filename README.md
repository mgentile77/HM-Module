Developing resource programs for use when playing RPGs 

This will create a horde of monsters of varying HP andf AC. The user will supply the number of monsters desired in the horde
and the max HP for the monster type.  The program will then produce random HP for each monster in the horde up to the 
max HP for the monster type.  This is will add an additional dimension to game play by varying the skill level and ac of monsters that may be of the same type by often attack in groups or hordes.

Additionally, this program will assist in quickly producing new characters.  The user will supply the character class,
race, and desired level.  The program will then generate a character with random numbers between 3-18 per each attribute.
It will then place the numbers in the attribute category that is typically the best fit for the character class.  It 
will then present and add race boosts to each attribute.  It will also present free points as per the desired level 
that the creator can then add to the desired attributes on their player sheets.  This is to help start game play faster for games that do not require players to start at level one while still providing some variablity in character creation.
